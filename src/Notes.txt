7. A default constructor is always provided by JAVA
8. Whatever we use after new is a constructor and it simply helps in constructing the object of a class.
9. "static" whenever static keyword is used, it makes the variable the property of the class instead of the property of the object.
10. Use the static keyword wherever you're trying to make a property which is independent of the object and is constant for a class and doesn't depend on the object.
11. Overriding the constructor by using the same name of the constructor but different parameters.
